# **Ride Sharing in Citites Analysis**
## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to dig deeper into the ridesharing metrics of rural, suburban, and urban cities. We will be looking at the volume of rides, drivers, and fares in these types of cities; and average fares for riders and drivers.

Urban cities had the most riders and the most drivers vs rural and suburban cities. Urban cities also lead in volume of fares. In fact 
The average fare per ride is lowest in urban cities, and rural cities have the highest fare per ride. 
The average fare per driver is also lowest in urban cities, and the average fare per driver is highest in rural cities. 
The average fare per driver in rural and suburban areas is higher than the average fare per rider. While in urban areas, the average fare per driver is less than the average fare per ride. This stems from the fact that urban areas have way more drivers than riders, while the opposite is true in Rural and suburban areas. 

## Summary
From this information we can make a few business recomendations. 
1. We must get more drivers in rural and suburban areas to meet demand. The spread between average fare per ride and average fare per driver is too big in rural and suburban areas, we want to aim at having a equal playing field between drivers and riders, so demand equals supply. We can do this by running some promotions to drivers in those rural areas.
2. There are too many drivers in the urban areas, this is causing too much competition in the urban areas. Each driver is making less in urban areas than they would be if they were in suburban or rural areas. This may cause a decline in drivers later on, because drivers can get discourgaed by not making enough money. To combat this we need to run promotions and ramp up advertising to get more riders on board. This will also increase sales in our highest demand cities.    
3. We need to put more emphasis on the suburban and rural areas, to get their fares volume to increase.
